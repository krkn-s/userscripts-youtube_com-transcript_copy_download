# YouTube Transcript Copy & Download Userscript

This userscript adds copy and download controls to the transcript panel on YouTube, making it easy to grab captions (with timestamps and metadata) for the current video in a single click.

I run it in Safari through the [Quotidian Userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts) extension. As of October 31, 2025, everything works as expected: the copy action sends the transcript to the clipboard, and the download action saves it as a text file.
